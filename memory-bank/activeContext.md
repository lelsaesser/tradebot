# Active Context

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and project insights.

## Current Work Focus
Fixed a critical bug in the weekly insider trading report that was causing `NoSuchElementException` when invalid stock symbols were present in the configuration.

## Recent Changes
- **Fixed InsiderTracker.java**: Replaced `StockSymbol.fromString(symbolString).orElseThrow()` with proper error handling that gracefully skips invalid symbols
- **Added resilient error handling**: The system now continues processing valid symbols even when invalid ones are present in the configuration
- **Added comprehensive test**: Created `trackInsiderTransactions_withInvalidSymbols_shouldSkipInvalidSymbolsGracefully()` test to verify the fix

## Next Steps
- Monitor production logs to ensure the fix resolves the weekly report failures
- Consider adding logging to track which symbols are being skipped
- Review other parts of the codebase for similar patterns that might need resilient error handling

## Active Decisions
- Chose to implement graceful error handling rather than trying to modify production configuration files
- Decided to silently skip invalid symbols to maintain system stability while processing valid ones

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- The project uses a scheduler-based approach to orchestrate tasks
- Components are loosely coupled using dependency injection
- Error handling is centralized in the `RootErrorHandler`
- **New pattern**: Graceful degradation when configuration contains invalid data - skip invalid entries and continue processing valid ones

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project is a trading bot with a clear, modular structure
- The use of Spring Boot and its scheduling features simplifies the orchestration of complex workflows
- **Critical insight**: Configuration files in production may contain symbols not defined in the enum, requiring resilient error handling
- The `StockSymbol` enum acts as a whitelist - only symbols defined there can be processed for insider tracking
- The system should be designed to handle configuration mismatches gracefully rather than failing completely

# Active Context

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and project insights.

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on understanding the existing codebase and populating the Memory Bank with accurate information about the project.

## Recent Changes
The Memory Bank files have been populated based on an analysis of the project's `pom.xml`, `Application.java`, and `Scheduler.java` files.

## Next Steps
- Review the implementation details of the core components.
- Verify the logic within each scheduled task.
- Implement the Telegram command processing logic.
- Secure API keys and other sensitive information.

## Active Decisions
The decision has been made to thoroughly document the existing project structure and functionality before making any changes or adding new features.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- The project uses a scheduler-based approach to orchestrate tasks.
- Components are loosely coupled using dependency injection.
- Error handling is centralized in the `RootErrorHandler`.

## Learnings and Project Insights
The project is a trading bot with a clear, modular structure. The use of Spring Boot and its scheduling features simplifies the orchestration of complex workflows. The `Scheduler.java` file provides a high-level overview of the application's capabilities.
